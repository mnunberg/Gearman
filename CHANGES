1.02
     -- Task objects weren't reusable before anyway, and now they're really not:
        when they complete or fail, they wipe all their internal subref members
        to break any potential loops.  also now support a new internal hook
        that happens after your on_complete or on_failure callback.  this
        is used by Gearman::Client::Async now, for cancelling timers.

1.01
     -- when workers are writing status messages up to parent, die on SIGPIPE,
        or really any write errors, but just trap SIGPIPE now, if parent goes away.
        fixes a bug found via Gearman::Client::Async's test suite.

1.00
     -- finally package it up and call it 1.00 now that we've been using
        it in (LiveJournal) production for quite a while, finding/fixing
        the bugs that happen when you put something into production.
